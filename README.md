# DAY-1
<br> <br>
 It is really proud to say that i was a member of the first student development program in the fablab.
 Our instructor Mr. Jaseel gave us a brief explanation of fablab and the scope of fablab. 
 His words was so impressive that many of us including me thought of taking fablab as a carrier option. 
 He also explained about the overall works to be done in this 2 week workshop. 
 He introduced new websites to us and asked us to make our own websites.
